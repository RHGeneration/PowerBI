Sales Report

So I thought I try out creating some data visuals from a sales reports using Power BI. 

There was a time we used to create similar visuals from excel using bar charts, line graphs etc. Only problem with them was we could only create one chart per document and we couldn't combine them or use real time stats to sync data so that it updates itself. Thanks to Power Bi, that has solved this problem.

Power Bi is a 100% free tool to download on Windows Store. Once on the app, you need to import some data before you can start creating visuals. I was super impressed with how much different types of data files it can accept as it has a huge collection!

You can merge cells and combine data too! For example I have a date, month and year cell. Back then you would have to create another column with a full date and write the whole dates per cell. With Power Bi, you can merge them, set parameters and changes the whole format and data in seconds. 

I say the real beauty of Power Bi is how you can create any charts, how you can sync data from a date so it shows either the whole total data or if you want to just view a certain year, it brings data just from that. I used Row bar charts, a map of cities the sales occurred, the total number of sales and a line graph to show the months that generated the most sales. You can select the year, select city and select the most sold product which you can get your total sale of that product.

Its certainly one of the best tools I use for making superb eye catching visual data rather than just looking at numbers.
